# This is the protocol for the simulation miner and validator.
# It is a simple request-response protocol where the validator sends a request
# to the miner, and the miner responds with a simulation_output response.

# ---- miner ----
# Example usage:
#   def simulation( synapse: Simulation ) -> Simulation:
#       synapse.simulation_output = synapse.simulation_input
#       return synapse
#   axon = bt.axon().attach( simulation ).serve(netuid=...).start()

# ---- validator ---
# Example usage:
#   dendrite = bt.Dendrite()
#   simulation_output = dendrite.query( Simulation( simulation_input = SimulationInput(time_increment=60, time_length=3600, num_simulations=10) ) )
#   assert simulation_output == np.array([[1.1, 2.2], [3.3, 4.4]], dtype=np.float64)
